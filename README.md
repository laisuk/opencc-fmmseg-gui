**OpenccNetLibGui** is a Chinese text conversion application built with Avalonia and the MVVM design pattern. It
leverages the [OpenccNetLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenccNetLib) library to provide simplified and traditional
Chinese conversion.

## Features

- **Chinese Conversion**  
  Convert text between Simplified and Traditional Chinese using optimized OpenCC lexicons combined with an efficient
  FMM-based dictionary matcher.

- **Single & Batch Conversion**  
  Convert individual files or entire directories in one operation.

- **Wide File Format Support**

  Import PDF files and automatically:
    - Extract text using **Pdfium** or **PdfPig**
    - Remove repetitive headers and footers (optional)
    - Merge broken lines across pages (e.g., `面` + `容` → `面容`)

## Notes

### **PDF Support**

Only **text-embedded PDFs** are supported.  
`OpenccNetLibGui` reads Unicode text directly from the PDF content stream using either `Pdfium` or `PdfPig`.

❌ Scanned PDFs or pure image-based PDFs **are not supported**.  
Such files require OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which is **not included** in this application.

---

### **PDF Extraction Engines**

`OpenccNetLibGui` offers two selectable engines for PDF text extraction:

- **Pdfium (native)**  
  A high-accuracy native engine with superior handling of:
    - CJK characters
    - complex layouts
    - overlapping glyphs
    - repeated text tokens
    - tricky multi-column or multi-page flows

- **PdfPig**  
  A pure-managed, cross-platform engine suitable for most standard text-embedded PDFs.

The preferred engine can be changed in the **Settings** context menu.

---

### **CJK Paragraph Reflow**

The CJK paragraph reflow module is designed as a **lightweight, text-only readability enhancement** for extracted
`PDF/EPUB` content.  
Its goal is to restore a **natural reading flow** for continuous text, especially CJK novels and prose.

It focuses on:

- Line merging for broken paragraph fragments
- Dialogue reconstruction across line breaks
- Basic chapter heading detection
- Removal of common page-level extraction artifacts

Reflowed output aims for **cleaner, novel-style plain-text readability**, but it is **not intended to:**

- reproduce original page layout
- preserve columns, tables, or typography
- support professional publishing or academic typesetting
- generate print-ready or editorial-grade output

Reflow intentionally applies **conservative, general heuristics** that work reasonably well across *many* documents,
rather than being optimized for any single PDF or personal formatting preference.

Users should treat reflowed text as a **draft-quality starting point**.  
If exact formatting or document-specific behavior is required, disabling Reflow and working with raw extracted text
is recommended.

## Dependencies

- **[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)**  
  Cross-platform .NET UI framework used to build the application’s user interface.

- **[AvaloniaEdit](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaEdit)**  
  A performant text editor control with syntax-highlighting, line numbers, and virtualization support.

- **[OpenccNetLib](https://github.com/laisuk/OpenccNet)**  
  Core conversion engine providing optimized OpenCC dictionary handling, FMM segmentation and multi-stage dictionary
  pipelines for Simplified/Traditional conversion.

- **[Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)**

1. Paste the text or open a file (text, DOCX, ODT, EPUB or PDF file) you wish to convert (file/text drag and drop are
   supported on
   Windows and macOS).
2. Select the desired conversion configuration (e.g., Simplified to Traditional).
3. `PDF options` can be set in reight-click context menu.
4. Click the **Process** button to see the results.

#### Notes

PDF Engine can be set in `LanguageSettings.json` as well:
Where:  
`1` = `PdfPig`, `2`= `Pdfium`

```json
{
  "pdfEngine": 1
}
```

`.epub`) and **PDF** (`.pdf`, introduced in `OpenccNetLibGui` v1.3.2).

1. Select or drag file(s) into the source list box (File(s), drag and drop currently only supported on Windows and
   macOS).
2. Select the desired conversion configuration.
3. Set the output folder.
4. For **PDF document** conversion, **right-click** List Box to set `PDF Options`. (`PDF engine`, `add page header`,
   `auto-reflow CJK text` etc.)
5. Click the **Batch Start** button to begin batch conversion.

### Dark Theme

![image05](./Assets/image05.png)
